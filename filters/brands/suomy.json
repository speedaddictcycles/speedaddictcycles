Still very much a light, high performance sport helmet, the SR Sport has a few creature comforts it's predecessors did not.  Included in that list an integrated chin curtain, more posh interior, and pod-less shield changes.  It was a long wait, but the Italian's did not disappoint.",

A round shape and three shell sizes make for a very snug fit, most street riders move up one size when fitting an Apex.  Do note the Apex is structurally identical to the Spec 1R; meaning it fits the same and uses the same visors.  The finish and graphics are not on the same level as the SR Sport, but for under $400 this helmet can't be beat.",

For starters you can hit freeways speeds and not worry about the visor jerking your head around.  This is  the number one complaint with dual sport lids.  Additionally Suomy was able to include a killer internal sun shield (very smooth action) and keep the weight down.  This is the lightest dual sport helmet we've tested to date.  Expect the MX Tour to fit snug, especially in the face.",

We also love the Airoh Aviator, BUT the Suomy is 2-3 ounces lighter and $200 less.
